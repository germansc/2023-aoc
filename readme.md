# 2023 - Advent of Code

This repo contains my solution to the 2023 Advent of Code puzzles.

This year, aside from completing the 25 day challenge, the goal is to use this
puzzles to learn a bit of Rust.

### Repo and Solution Structure

Each day will be contained in a different directory, as a cargo project, along
with the sample and input for each puzzle. All solutions will be implemented to
take input from `stdin`, and print the result in `stdout`.

### Compilation and Usage

To compile and run a solution, simply call:

```bash
cd day01
cargo run < input.txt
```
